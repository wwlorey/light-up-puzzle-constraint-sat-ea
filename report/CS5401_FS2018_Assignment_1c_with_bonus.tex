\section{Introduction}

Assignment 1c involved implementing an EA leveraging constraint satisfaction to
more effectively solve Light Up puzzles. This report compares the performance of
penalty function and repair function constraint satisfaction techniques as well as
plain-vanilla EA performance. It also outlines a comparison between Validity Forced plus 
Uniform Random versus plain Uniform Random initialization for a plain-vanilla EA,
a constraint satisfaction EA employing a penalty function, and a constraint satisfaction
EA employing a repair function. The extent to which EA performance is affected by 
the penalty coefficient used in penalty function constraint satisfaction EAs will also be examined.


\section{Constraint Satisfaction EA Performance Comparisons}

For the baseline assignment, an EA leveraging a penalty function was implemented. The penalty function
subtracted from a given genotype's fitness the number of constraints violated multiplied by a
penalty coefficient. Violated constraints involved bulbs shining on other bulbs and black cell
constraints not being met.

This EA was compared to an EA implemented for the bonus assignment that used the repair function
constraint satisfaction technique. Figure \ref{fig:website_puzzle_validity_enforced_graph} and Figure 
\ref{fig:website_puzzle_validity_enforced_bonus_graph} show evaluations versus fitness for the 
penalty function EA and the repair function EA respectively tested against the Light Up puzzle provided
on the course website. Figure \ref{fig:random_gen_validity_enforced_graph} and Figure \ref{fig:random_gen_validity_enforced_bonus_graph} 
show evaluations versus fitness for the aforementioned EAs tested against randomly generated puzzles. Note that 
for situations where the best fitness for a solution plateaus, there is possibility of encountering a decreasing average fitness
as higher mutation factors are introduced to combat a stagnant population.

Through visually examining each configuration's fitness plots, it appears that the penalty function EA 
outperforms the repair function EA. However, statistical analysis seen in Table \ref{rand_constr} and Table \ref{provided_constr}
proves that for randomly generated puzzles, neither constraint satisfaction method yields a more effective EA. Note that the table
headers correspond to the configuration files used to generate the data upon which statistical analysis was performed and that
all statistical analysis consisted of the F-Test Two-Sample for Variances followed by the t-test Two-Sample Assuming either Unequal or
Equal Variances depending on the F-Test output.
A performance boost was proven when examining the provided puzzle tests, proving that the penalty function EA was in fact
optimal when compared to the repair function EA for that problem. 

The vanilla EA tested on a validity enforced initialization (Figure \ref{fig:website_puzzle_validity_enforced_vanilla_graph} 
and Figure \ref{fig:random_gen_validity_enforced_vanilla_graph}) performed very poorly compared to the constraint satisfaction EAs.
This is because with black cell adjacency constraints enforced, invalid solutions produce fitness values of zero. With many invalid solutions
dominating the population, no search gradient is provided and the EA struggles to find any solution.


\section{Initialization Comparisons}

The effect of Validity Forced plus Uniform Random versus plain Uniform Random was examined
regarding the plain-vanilla EA, the penalty function EA, and the repair function EA.

The comparison for the plain-vanilla EA tested against the randomly generated puzzle
(graphed in Figure \ref{fig:random_gen_uniform_random_vanilla_graph}
and Figure \ref{fig:random_gen_validity_enforced_vanilla_graph}, and analyzed in Table \ref{uniform_vs_validity_vanilla_rand})
proved that neither initialization method led to quantifiable improvements. Granted, neither plain-vanilla EA configuration
managed to reliably find meaningful solutions.

Figure \ref{fig:random_gen_validity_enforced_graph} and Figure \ref{fig:random_gen_uniform_random_graph} 
illustrate the penalty function EA configuration tested with both Uniform Random and 
Validity Enforced plus Uniform Random for randomly generated puzzles. Figure \ref{fig:website_puzzle_validity_enforced_graph} 
and Figure \ref{fig:website_puzzle_uniform_random_graph} illustrate
the same comparison for the provided puzzle. The statistical analysis comparing these two 
configurations can be found in Table \ref{uniform_penalty_vs_validity_penalty_rand} and Table \ref{uniform_vs_validity_penalty_provided}.

This statistical analysis showed that for randomly generated puzzles, neither initialization method
made a quantifiable improvement on the EA's results. Randomly generated puzzles are generally less
complicated to solve, so the Validity Enforced initialization's lack of impact in this case is justified.

The analysis also showed that the EA was more sensitive to initialization configuration
for the provided puzzle, an objectively difficult puzzle to solve. The Validity Enforced Uniform Random
initialization configured EA proved to be statistically better than the Uniform Random initialization
configured EA for this problem instance. Since enforcing validity upon initialization shrinks the search space by ensuring the validity
of conditions that can only be fulfilled one way (such as a `3' valued black cell placed along an edge leads to one single way to
ensure that constraint is valid), and since the search space is more difficult to traverse for 
highly difficult puzzles, Validity Enforced Uniform Random initialization produces a higher performing EA for 
the provided puzzle.


\section{The Penalty Coefficient and its Effect on Solution Quality}

The penalty function EA, tested against the provided puzzle, was configured using three different penalty coefficients
to test their effect on the EA's performance. The first coefficient tested was a small coefficient, equating to 0.25. The
second was the medium coefficient, equating to 3. The third was the large coefficient, equating to 10. The fitness graphs for
each of these coefficients may be found in Figure \ref{fig:website_puzzle_validity_enforced_small_penalty_graph},
Figure \ref{fig:website_puzzle_validity_enforced_med_penalty_graph}, and Figure 
\ref{fig:website_puzzle_validity_enforced_large_penalty_graph} respectively.

In order to properly compare each configuration, pairwise statistical analysis was performed between each pair of coefficient types
(small, medium, and large). Analysis comparing the small and medium coefficients (Table \ref{small_vs_med}) showed that the small
penalty coefficient of 0.25 led to an EA that outperformed the EA configured with the medium coefficient of 3. The comparison between
the medium and large coefficients (Table \ref{med_vs_large}) led to the conclusion that, again, the smaller coefficient configured EA 
outperformed the larger penalty coefficient configured EA. This conclusion was also drawn from the last comparison, comparing the small
penalty coefficient to the large penalty coefficient (Table \ref{small_vs_large}).

In each comparison case, the smaller penalty function led to a higher best fitness and a higher average population fitness when
all run data was averaged. This is because when invalid individuals that do not meet all constraints are penalized, their fitness decreases
by a small fraction for smaller penalty coefficients and by a larger fraction for larger penalty coefficients. The final population of a
penalty function configured EA using a small penalty function may actually have the same number of invalid solutions as the population of an
EA configured with a large penalty coefficient, but the small coefficient EA will read as having higher fitness values. With this fact in mind,
it is also important to consider the reason a penalty function constraint satisfaction method is used. Employing a penalty function allows for
invalid solutions to be examined with the hope that those invalid solutions lead to a valid solution after some exploration. This can be 
equated to traversing the `sea' of validity on the way to a more optimal solution. Keeping the penalty coefficient relatively small incentivises
the traversal of invalid areas of the search space, possibly allowing for a more optimal solution to be discovered.
